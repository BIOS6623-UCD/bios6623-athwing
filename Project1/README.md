## Project 1

#### Directory Structure
The general info on this project is: 
1) SAS and R analysis and data management files can be 
found in the Code folder; 
2) Reports contain the graphs and figures from my code and the
reports that were created along the way; 
3) Docs contains graphs and figures at times and
other things like investigator questions or docs the investigator sent me. 

#### Question of Interest
We are interested in understanding how treatment response 2 years after initiating HAART differs between 
subjects who report using hard drugs, such as heroine and cocaine, at baseline and other subjects, who did not 
report hard drug use at baseline.
