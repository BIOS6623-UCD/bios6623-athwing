# ABOUT ME

This is [Annie's](https://athwing.github.io) github repository for BIOS 6623. I am a second year MS biostatistics student and am excited to be taking this class.

I edited this file first on the github website by going to my directory, clicking the pencil icon and editing the readme.md file.

Next I downloaded GitKraken, which I did not previously have, cloned my repository, and then went to the Repositories folder in my Home directory, and opened up the ReadMe.md file from here, I am currently editing it in Xcode, and once I am done I will push it back.

I have worked with markdown in the past on the GitHub website, I like editing it on the website since you can click "Preview" and see what it looks like before you commit back.
