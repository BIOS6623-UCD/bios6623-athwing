# ABOUT ME

My name is [Annie](https://athwing.github.io) and I am second year MS Biostatistics student.  This is my github repository for BIOS 6623, and I am very excited to be taking this class.

I edited this file first on the github website by going to my directory, clicking the pencil icon and editing the ReadMe.md file.

Next I downloaded GitKraken, which I did not previously have, cloned my repository, and then went to the Repositories folder in the Home directory of my computer, opened up the ReadMe.md file to edit in XCode and then pushed it back to GitHub.

I have enjoyed working with markdown in the past on other repositories, although I like working with it much better on the website because I am able to preview my changes before I commit them.
