# BIOS6623Class

This folder contains the project materials for BIOS6623 minus datasets.  The datasets are not in this repository because you never know when data contains sensitive information. So, we want to minimize the risk that data could be accidentally shared. We have created folder templates for all projects. These provide one way of organizing work in an common framework.

For this class, the datasets can be found on CANVAS.

This is Annie Thwing's github repository for BIOS 6623. I edited this file by opening up my repository on github, and then clicking the pencil icon by the readme.md file.
