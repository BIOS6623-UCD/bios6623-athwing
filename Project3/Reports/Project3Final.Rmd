## Questions of Interest:

- What is the rate of memory decline based on these measures over the aging process in healthy individuals?
- What is the rate of memory decline based on these measures over the aging process in those diagnosed with MCI/dementia during the study?
- Is there a period of time before the diagnosis of MCI/dementia in which the rate of the memory decline changes (or accelerates)?

## Approach

1. Make sure data is cleaned: remove individuals with less than three measurements of category fluency for animals
2. Fit a linear mixed model, account for correlation of measurements within a person by allowing for a random intercept, adjust for age, gender, socioeconomic status, dementia status, and age*dementia interaction and tau
3. Find a "change point", time point at which the rate of memory decline changed in those individuals diagnosed with dementia as opposed to those without dementia
4. Determine a measure of variation around the estimates of decline in the model and the change point

## Conclusions
- The slope for those with dementia was not significantly different from those without dementia before the change point
- The slope for those with dementia was significantly different from those without dementia after the change point

  - Future considerations: consider other 3 outcomes, look for trends
