#### Question of Interest
Our general questions of interest are:

* What is the rate of memory decline based on these measures over the aging process in healthy individuals?
* What is the rate of memory decline based on these measures over the aging process in those diagnosed with MCI/dementia during the study?
* Is there a period of time before the diagnosis of MCI/dementia in which the rate of the memory decline changes (or accelerates)?
* At what time prior to MCI/dementia diagnosis do the rates of decline change in those with MCI/dementia?
